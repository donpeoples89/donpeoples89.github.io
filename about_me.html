        <p> I have been making websites for a couple years now. The first website I made was with
            Wix! (lol). It got the job done, but the service was very expensive and unfulfilling.
            Shortly after, I jumped in way over my head and developed a word press site.
            This was a frustrating experience because at the time I had no prior knowledge of the web
            yet alone, how to code. It got to the point where it became extremely time consuming, only  with
            untreated results.</p>
